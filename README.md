# my_city_site
A solo project created for the Scrimba Front End Development Course.


Using CSS and HTML, I created a static website showing three things tourists can do in Lagos, Nigeria, the city I grew up in.
This was done in response to the solo project prompt from the Scrimba Front End Development Course.
